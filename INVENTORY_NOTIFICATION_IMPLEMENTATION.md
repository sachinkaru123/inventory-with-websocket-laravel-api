# Inventory Broadcasting Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a professional, robust solution for broadcasting inventory count notifications when thresholds are reached. Instead of directly broadcasting events from console commands (which can be problematic), we use Laravel's job queue system for reliable event broadcasting.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Console Command** (`ListenForItemCount`)
   - Listens to PostgreSQL notifications
   - Triggers the notification process when threshold is reached
   - Uses dependency injection and configuration

2. **Notification Service** (`InventoryNotificationService`)
   - Handles business logic for inventory notifications
   - Determines severity levels
   - Manages threshold calculations
   - Dispatches broadcast jobs

3. **Broadcast Job** (`BroadcastItemCountExceeded`)
   - Queued job for reliable event broadcasting
   - Includes retry logic and error handling
   - Properly logs all activities
   - Handles failures gracefully

4. **Event** (`ItemCountExeed`)
   - Broadcast event with proper channel configuration
   - Structured data payload
   - Implements `ShouldBroadcastNow` for immediate broadcasting

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Inventory notification threshold
INVENTORY_NOTIFICATION_THRESHOLD=20

# Broadcasting driver (pusher, redis, etc.)
BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher

# Optional: Email and Slack notifications
INVENTORY_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=false
INVENTORY_SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS=false
```

### Configuration File

See `config/inventory.php` for detailed configuration options including:
- Notification thresholds
- Severity levels
- Broadcasting settings
- Database listener configuration

## Usage

### Running the Command

```bash
php artisan items:listen
```

This will start the PostgreSQL listener that monitors for inventory count notifications.

### Queue Worker

Make sure you have a queue worker running to process the broadcast jobs:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

### Manual Triggering

You can manually trigger a notification using the service:

```php
use App\Services\InventoryNotificationService;

$service = new InventoryNotificationService();
$service->handleCountThresholdReached(20);
```

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Reliability**: Jobs can be retried if broadcasting fails
2. **Scalability**: Queue system handles high load scenarios
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging at all levels
4. **Testability**: All components are unit testable
5. **Configuration**: Easily configurable through environment variables
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with proper logging
7. **Professional Structure**: Follows Laravel best practices

## Severity Levels

- **Info** (< 100% of threshold): Informational notification
- **Warning** (100-119% of threshold): Standard warning
- **High** (120-149% of threshold): High priority alert
- **Critical** (â‰¥150% of threshold): Critical alert requiring immediate attention

## Error Handling

The implementation includes multiple layers of error handling:

1. **Command Level**: Catches and logs service errors
2. **Service Level**: Handles database and dispatch errors
3. **Job Level**: Includes retry logic and permanent failure handling

## Testing

Run the included tests to verify functionality:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/InventoryNotificationTest.php
```

## Monitoring

All activities are logged with appropriate levels:
- Info: Successful operations
- Debug: Detailed operation information
- Error: Failures and exceptions

Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for monitoring the system.
